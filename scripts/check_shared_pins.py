"""Observe the local toolchain and let Engineering Assurance classify it (FR-006-AC-1).

Four things this file deliberately is not.

It is not a copy of the compatibility matrix. It never says which version of
anything is correct. It observes what is installed and hands every verdict to
`engineering_assurance.compatibility`, because a second copy of the rule is a
second authority, and two authorities drift.

It is not an acceptance gate. The pinned release records
`accepted.state = pending_human_acceptance` and ships no
`human_acceptance_recorded` predicate (agent-ix/engineering-assurance#20). This
script reports the acceptance state the installed distribution carries and gates
only on things that are local and checkable. An absent field is not read as an
approval, and it is not read as a rejection either.

It is not a network probe. It does not ask a registry whether a release landed.
`npm.ix` in particular is a mirror that lags the public registry and is not an
oracle for anything; the only thing this script does about it is refuse to find
it written down anywhere in this repository.

It is not an envelope. It prints a report and exits. It retains nothing.

Exit status: 0 when every component is compatible and no local check fails,
1 when something is not compatible, 2 when Engineering Assurance itself cannot
be loaded — which is a different fact from a failing check and gets its own code.
