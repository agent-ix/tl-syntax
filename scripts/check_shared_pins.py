"""Observe the local toolchain and let Engineering Assurance classify it (FR-006-AC-1).

Four things this file deliberately is not.

It is not a copy of the compatibility matrix. It never says which version of
anything is correct. It observes what is installed and hands every verdict to
`engineering-assurance compatibility`, because a second copy of the rule is a
second authority, and two authorities drift.

It is not an acceptance authority. The native EA compatibility result carries
both version classification and human acceptance; this gate requires both.
The candidate v0.3.2 matrix withholds until its owner records acceptance.

It is not a network probe. It does not ask a registry whether a release landed.
`npm.ix` in particular is a mirror that lags the public registry and is not an
oracle for anything; the only thing this script does about it is refuse to find
it written down anywhere in this repository.

It is not an envelope. It prints a report and exits. It retains nothing.

Exit status: 0 when the EA gate is satisfied and no local check fails,
1 when the EA gate or a local check is unsatisfied, 2 when the EA CLI cannot
be used — which is a different fact from a failing check and gets its own code.
