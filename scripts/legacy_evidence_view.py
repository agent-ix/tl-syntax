"""Read this repository's retained evidence through the pinned shared mapping (FR-006-AC-4).

Four things this file deliberately is not.

It is not a mapping. Every byte it interprets is interpreted by
`engineering_assurance.verification_semantics.map_pgm01_bytes` from the pinned
release. This file chooses which bytes to hand over and reports what came back.
If the answer is unwelcome, the answer is still the answer.

It is not a verifier. It replaces `verify_evidence.sh`, `verify_evidence_tree.py`,
`verify_evidence_manifest.py`, `evidence_profile.py` and `finalize_collection.py`,
and it does not inherit their job. It does not decide whether a retained record
qualifies anything, does not maintain an anchor file, and has no notion of an
active record.

It is not a writer. It opens every file under `evidence/` for reading and proves
it: it digests the whole tree before and after the run and fails if one byte
moved. Read-only is a claim, so it is measured.

It is not a translator of last resort. This repository's 23 retained envelopes
are `quire.derivation-evidence/v1`. The pinned mapping covers
`quire.pgm01-evidence` v1 and v2 and answers `incompatible` for the rest. That
refusal is reported as the compatibility result. Writing a local mapper to turn
it into something friendlier is the exact thing the migration removed.

Exit status: 0 when every declared case matched and no evidence byte moved,
1 when a case did not match or bytes moved, 2 when the pinned release cannot be
loaded.
